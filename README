A tiny parser for a custom markup language.

It's implemented as a single-header ISO C99 file (`markup_parser.h`).
Api documentation is in that file.

Check out `markup_to_html.c` for a simple usage example.

Here is a web playground: http://zagortenay333.github.io/markup_parser
The playground contains informal documentation of the markup language.

There are some tests and it's written in strict C99 with usage of sanitizers.
It has not been battle-tested in any way though.
